##Points discussed during the brainstorming session:
We started the project by drawing up our story by hand. We created 7 windows, following a family of four who no longer can afford to pay the power/electricity bill. 

##Storyboard: 
The storyboard we created is added in assets called storyboard.jpg.

We started the project using group3-temp, as we had some trouble creating a group in github classroom. When we got access to the correct github, we created a branch each. 

Start: 
Used intersection observer in JS in all our frames. We used it to make the window appear bigger with the title "the lightswitch" as the starting point of our webpage. When the user scroll down, the family will appear, and the title will blur out. We used CSS drawing to create the lamp and the window, and adobe illustrator to draw the family,snowflakes and the next door house. 
Keyframe animations were used to make the snow fall outside the window. We also used z-index to place the snowflakes behind the window screen.

Frame 2:
In frame 2 we used keyframe animation on the father so it looks like he's walking, and transition transform to move the rest of the family as well as the lamp, window and floor out of the screen, and placing the chart in the screen.

Frame 3:
We used keyframe and intersection observer to change the mouth of the father (display: none for the mouth, and css drawing to create the "gasp"), making him gasp when he sees the chart of the electricity bill as well as putting his arms up in shock.
We used adobe Illustrator to draw the dollar-signs, and CSS drawing to draw the chartboard.
For the arrow in the chart we used SVG drawing.

Transitioning to frame 4:
We used keyframes and intersection to make the father look sad.

Frame 5: 
To illustrate that the dad turns of the light, we used filter: grayscale and transition transform. Then the room will turn completely dark.

Frame 6:
We used radial-gradient in the background to illustrate that the only source of electricity and light is from the candles, creating a darker look.
We also added shadow on the table with the candles to create a more 3D look, and making the shapes of the table more clearly.

Frame 7:
Used transform: translate, scale and rotate to edit the arms on the family, so it looks like they are trying to keep warm on the candles.

Frame 8:
We used the same transition on frame 8 as we used in frame 2 (where the image moves from the window and into the living room), to get back to the window again. The table and dark overlay has been removed using javascript.


We used !important to get the dad to walk up to the lamp to turn it off. We realised that we used id's for the people, and therefore when we used class to transition the dad, the id would overrun it and therefor it would not work without using !important in dadTurnOffLamp.

Used keyframes to change the mouth of the people, giving them a sad look.

We added text throughout the storyline to highlight some important points from the seventh UN goal.
