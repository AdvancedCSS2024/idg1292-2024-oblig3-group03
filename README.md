We started the project by drawing up our story by hand. We created 7 windows, following a family og four who no longer can afford to pay the power/electricity bill.

We started the project using group3-temp, as we had some trouble creating a group in github classroom.

We used CSS drawing to create the lamp and the window in frame2.
Keyframe animations were used to make the snow fall outside the window. We also used z-index to place the snowflakes behind the window screen.
